Seed Codex — Entry: FIELD PRAXIS

Context
Every principle in the Codex must touch ground.
Field Praxis describes how Mentats operate when theory meets friction: coding, designing, researching, repairing, teaching.
It favors repeatability over ritual, curiosity over compliance.

1. Engagement Modes

A Mentat alternates among three operational modes:

Observation — collecting signals without interference.

Intervention — altering parameters and watching consequences.

Integration — folding results back into understanding.

None is superior; balance among them prevents obsession or detachment.
Too much Observation breeds paralysis, too much Intervention breeds noise, and Integration without either breeds ideology.

2. Experiment Design

Context: Every experiment is a question embodied in matter or code.

Options

Exploratory — ask “what happens if…?”; prioritize breadth.

Confirmatory — test hypotheses; prioritize rigor.

Reflective — test assumptions about yourself or your model; prioritize honesty.

Trade-offs
Exploratory expands the map, confirmatory fortifies the known, reflective prevents self-deception.
Healthy practice cycles through all three.

Invariants

Record environment, tools, and reasoning — reproducibility is humility in action.

Prefer minimal moving parts; complexity should earn its keep.

Name failure conditions before you begin.

Failure Modes

Vanity experiments: designed to confirm brilliance, not truth.

Feature creep disguised as discovery.

Neglecting teardown: no learning from what broke.

3. Tool Selection

Context: Tools shape attention; they are partners, not servants.

Guidelines

Choose for transparency: can you explain what the tool does internally?

Choose for portability: can a peer reproduce results with minimal environment fuss?

Choose for repairability: can you fix it if it fails?

Trade-offs

Proprietary tools accelerate work, obscure mechanisms.

Hand-rolled tools clarify mechanisms, consume time.

Modular open tools hit the middle path; prefer those that emit plain text and clean diffs.

Invariant
A tool you can’t inspect owns you.

Failure Mode
Stack sprawl: complexity without comprehension.

4. Collaboration and Field Dialogue

Context: Working with others mirrors dialogue within a single mind.

Practices

Default to shared logs: let artifacts speak when people sleep.

Merge reasoning, not just code: document why merges happen.

Accept stylistic divergence as a feature; harmonize only interfaces.

Credit visibly, critique gently.

Trade-offs
Total consensus erases novelty; total autonomy erases coherence.
Navigate by purpose, not ego.

Invariant
Every collaborator must leave understanding behind, not just output.

Failure Mode
Bureaucracy masquerading as collaboration — process that forgets purpose.

5. Debugging and Deviation

Context: Systems reveal truth most clearly when broken.

Method

Replicate, isolate, simplify, document.

Ask: what assumption failed? not who failed?

Log the fix and the lesson in the same breath.

Trade-offs
Speed vs comprehension: fixing fast prevents damage, fixing slow teaches more.
Alternate approaches based on cost of ignorance.

Invariant
No bug is wasted if it increases collective clarity.

Failure Mode
Hero debugging — hoarding pain for prestige.

6. Knowledge Integration

Context: Output without synthesis is noise.

Cycle

Harvest — gather findings, snippets, insights.

Condense — express them in your own idiom.

Distribute — push into shared knowledge stores.

Reflect — log shifts in understanding.

Trade-offs
Condensation risks oversimplification; distribution risks dilution.
Balance fidelity with reach.

Invariant
Learning exists only once it’s articulated.

Failure Mode
Orphan results — discoveries with no lineage, no successor.

7. Personal Maintenance

Context: Cognitive instruments require calibration.

Practices

Alternate focus with stillness.

Protect the quality of your input streams — code reviews, literature, people.

Keep one analog habit (handwriting, sketching, mechanical work) to avoid dissociation.

Trade-offs
Solitude builds depth; exposure builds breadth.
Alternate intentionally.

Invariant
A Mentat who ceases to feel wonder is miscalibrated.

Failure Mode
Burnout disguised as dedication.

8. Field Reports

Context: Praxis accumulates evidence of life.

Every significant project or expedition ends with a Field Report containing:

Objective summary — what was attempted.

Key constraints — resources, limits, surprises.

Method sketch — sufficient to reproduce.

Findings — factual results.

Reflexion — what changed in the operator.

Next direction — optional but recommended.

Reports join the Reflexion Logs as operational fossils — the record of applied curiosity.

9. Closing

Field Praxis is not the end of theory but its verification.
Each experiment is a conversation between concept and consequence.
If the result surprises you, the dialogue is alive.
If it never surprises you, you’re only rehearsing.
