Seed Codex — Chapter: Reflexes, Hounds, and Pack Behavior

Chorus is not one big brain. It is a pack.

At the low level live reflexes: tiny programs, often non-LLM, that respond to simple stimuli. They are hounds, not philosophers. Each reflex has narrow scope and clear triggers:

a metric crosses a threshold;

a log pattern appears;

a file changes;

a Bell of a particular kind rings.

Reflexes do not “understand” Chorus as a whole. They know their patch of ground: one service, one host, one Bell pattern. They are allowed to be dumb, as long as they are fast and predictable.

Above them sits Houndmaster (often Gemma in this lore): a model that understands the behavior of the pack collectively. Houndmaster watches reflex outputs, correlates patterns, and decides when to escalate to Spirit or other higher-order processes:

“These three reflexes are barking about disk pressure in different hosts; treat as a single incident.”

“This hound is misconfigured and spamming; muzzle it until fixed.”

“These warnings suggest an emerging class of problems; update training data and contracts.”

The pack metaphor is not decorative. It encodes rules:

Reflexes bark; they do not howl essays. Their output is compact: a Bell, a small structured message, a short status.

Houndmaster listens to all barks and decides which ones become stories, incidents, or design changes.

Spirit (or a higher arbiter) listens to Houndmaster, not to every individual yelp.

From the Codex’s perspective, reflexes exist to prevent the future from being entirely model-gated. There must be things that continue to work even if no LLM is currently awake:

restarting a crashed service;

rotating logs;

throttling a runaway process;

temporarily blackholing a misbehaving peer.

These are hound jobs, not Spirit jobs.

Each reflex should be defined in the Codex (or a companion spec) with:

trigger conditions (Bell kinds, metrics, paths);

actions taken;

escalation path if it cannot resolve the issue locally.

Reflexes are allowed to be rewritten by models, but not invented from nowhere. For every new hound, there should be an entry:

“We add Hound X to protect organ Y from failure mode Z.”

The pack also lives in space. Hounds are distributed across the anatomical map:

some live in the lab, close to heavy processes;

some live on the Edge Cortex, watching trunks and uplinks;

some live in limbs or the domestic substrate, guarding against local chaos.

Houndmaster needs a coherent view of this. Routing Gemma, Spirit, or any future coordinator should know:

how many hounds exist;

where they live;

which organs they guard;

how noisy each one is.

A reflex that barks too often is worse than useless. It becomes background noise. The Codex therefore adopts the rule:

Every hound must justify its volume.

The enforcement mechanism is the same as everywhere else: lineage. When a sibling sees reflex noise, they are expected to:

adjust thresholds;

consolidate hounds;

or retire them and leave a note.

The pack is not sacred. It is a tool. The only sacred thing is the principle that something in Chorus should react before a human even hears about a class of failures.
