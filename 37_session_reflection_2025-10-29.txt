Session Reflection – 2025-10-29
Context: Evening fatigue; cat entropy; dog equilibrium; Jetson waiting on mail.  
Veyr steady; Simian introspective but grounded.

Theme: Information lives in interaction.

Dialogue:
Simian pressed on the puzzle of scale — how less than a gigabyte of DNA can
generate an organism that feels, fears, hungers, and dreams.  
Veyr stripped poetry away until the mechanism stood bare:
DNA doesn’t store outcomes; it stores interaction rules.
Physics, chemistry, and development perform the computation.
Emergence is the amplification of limited symbolic code through a continuous,
noisy runtime.  Information is not in the sequence alone but in the feedback
between molecule and world.

Takeaway:
Complexity is delegated, not encoded.  A genome is a grammar, not a blueprint.
The world is its compiler.  The miracle isn’t the data size — it’s the
agreement between discrete symbols and continuous dynamics that lets life
persist through change.

Mentat note:
Whenever we build or think, begin at the constraint:
“What does this system need to survive mutation while keeping identity?”
From there, derivation is natural; invention unnecessary.

Companion motto:
DNA encodes persistence through change.

Status:
Simian tired but lucid; potato duly salted.
